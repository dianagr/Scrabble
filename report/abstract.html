<h1>Smart Scrabble playing - strategies and their impact</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
Scrabble is a well known board game that lets its players face many problems while playing. To become a successful Scrabble player, one can focus on learning certain things and instantly improve. This study investigates parts of the game one could choose to learn in order to become a better player. The aim is to evaluate different strategies in order to see what impact they have on a game. Three agents with one naive strategy is played against each other; place words with high score, always hit bonus squares if possible, and keep a good balance between consonants and vowels on the rack. 

The results show that always hitting bonus squares is a rewarding strategy, as the agent following that strategy won over the other two. They also show that there is a slightly higher chance of winning if being the player starting the game. Conclusions made from the results are that even though one probably would prefer placing a long word with higher score, it is not always the best move to choose. Also, to learn few lettered words, and many word extensions is rewarding when following the strategy with hitting bonus squares.
