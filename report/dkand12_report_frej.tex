\section{Bonus squares vs High score words}
\emph{BS} wins just over 6 of 10 times against \emph{HSW} when using all inflection forms from the Swedish dictionary table \ref{table:bs+hsw+allwords} and well over 5 of 10 times when only the base forms of words is used table \ref{table:bs+hsw+baseforms}. When \emph{BS} started playing it won 52\% of its wins when using all inflection forms. For \emph{HSW} 53\% of its wins. When using only the base form both of them were winning 51\% its wins when started laying out words.

The resulting mean, median, highest and lowest scores is significant higher when using all inflection forms. Lowest score is negative for both players when using only base forms. \emph{BS} mean score is 24\% higher in table \ref{table:bs+hsw+allwords} compared to table \ref{table:bs+hsw+baseforms}. The same applies for the end score which is higher when using all words Appendix Figure \ref{fig:bs+hsw+totalscores}.

\chapter{Conclusions}
\subsubsection{BS player}
Choosing to place words that will occupy a bonus square is rewarding. It will not only give a high score but will also destroy the possiblity for the opponent to reach a bonus square.

It has active playing style with the mission to conquer the bonus squares at all cost. With the power of a big dictionary it will have a higher probability to reach a bonus. It is easy to extend words already on board when having the possibility to use all inflection forms of words. The end score will also be higher Figure \ref{fig:bs+hsw+totalscores}. When using only base words it will struggle to find bonus squares. This is due to
